To install the files, simple type in the source directory

$  mkdir build
$  cd build
$  cmake ..
$  make
#  make install

of course, you can specify an other installation directory with cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, and not have
to run make install as root.

There are two applications installed:
  - A simple console application called 'simple' where you can easily type in some equations, formulars, etc.
  - (only if KDE is installed) a KRunner plugin, where you can also easily type in the same equations after '=',
    e. g. you can type in '=a+a' which then becomes 2*a

the prerequisites are
  cmake
  make
  a c++ compiler like gcc
  gmp see http://gmplib.org
  bison	see http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/
  flex see http://flex.sourceforge.net/
  bisonc++ http://sourceforge.net/projects/bisoncpp/

optional prequesites for an integration in KRunner: 
  KDE 4 see http://kde.org

the project should be platform independent, but is only tested on linux, yet
it does only uses standard c++ and gmp, flex and bisonc++ (without KRunner plugin of course)
