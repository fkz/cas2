make include's of files possible

planned output format:

  input: file.rule
  output:
    file.rule.generated -- generated file to provide access for compilation issues for include's etc.
    file.rule.generated.h -- file to include to know defined types and so on
    file.rule.generated.cpp -- file, which has to be compiled
    output/name.cpp -- file with simplify rules
    output/name_classes.h -- file which contains classes defined in file.rule
    output/name.h -- file which contains the classes 
    output/name_plugin.cpp -- file which creates the links needed for the plugin

plugin structure:

  the following links have to be provided:
   for a plugin named PLUGIN_NAME:

  extern "C" CreateClass *PLUGIN_NAMEClass ();
  extern "C" SimplifyClass *PLUGIN_NAMESimplify ();

the memory management has to be done from the sources then.
